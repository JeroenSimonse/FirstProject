                <p>The Federal Reserve on Wednesday will provide its final update for the year on its easy money policies, with all signs pointing to a quicker draw down of its pandemic-era stimulus.
                    Policymakers will likely point to higher inflationary prints to justify a speedier "taper" of its asset purchase program.
                    Since the depths of the pandemic, the Fed has added trillions in U.S. Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities to its balance sheet, part of an effort to signal to markets its intention to keep financing conditions easy. In November, the Fed charted a course for slowing those purchases that would bring the entire program to a full stop by the middle of next year.
                    But with inflation clocking in at 6.8% on a year-over-year basis, Fed officials now see a case for hastening that taper and ending the program earlier.
                    That would give the Fed the optionality to move earlier — and perhaps more aggressively — on raising interest rates next year. At the conclusion of Wednesday's meeting, the Fed will release a new set of "dot plot" projections mapping out policymakers' expectations for where interest rates will be in the coming years.
                    The Federal Open Market Committee will release its policy statement at 2 p.m. ET with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET.</p>

                <h1 class="H1">$ROKU down 10%</h1>
                <p>Investing.com – Roku stock (NASDAQ:ROKU) plunged 8% Wednesday after Universal Electronics claimed victory in a patent infringement case it was pursuing against the maker of remotes and streaming devices.
                    Universal Electronics shares (NASDAQ:UEIC) rose 5%.
                    According to Universal, the United States International Trade Commission has banned Roku from importing infringing “televisions, set top boxes, remote control devices, streaming devices and sound bars.”
                    Roku is allowed to import items provided they don’t infringe on Universal’s patents, according to the order. Universal makes remotes compatible with a range of electronics.
                    The order, issued Dec. 3, will become final on Jan. 9. Until then, President Joe Biden has time to review the order and even overturn it.
                    The ITC hears disputes about imported goods that infringe on U.S. patents or imports that hurt the domestic industry because of unfair trade practices in the exporting country.
                    Universal filed the complaint last year against Roku and TV-makers TCL and Hisense at the ITC for infringing several patents. The case was later narrowed to include only Roku.
                    Universal is also pursuing cases against Roku in the district court in central California.</p>
